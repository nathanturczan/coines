================ Bosch Sensortec COINES =====================================

This package contains the Bosch Sensortec COINES (COmmunication with 
INertial and Environmental Sensors) sensor evaluation software.

The software provides a low-level interface to Bosch Sensortec's 
Application Board APP2.0. The user can access Bosch Sensortec's MEMS 
sensors through a C interface. COINES can be used along with SensorAPI 
of the sensor, which is part of the software installation, but can also 
be obtained from https://github.com/BoschSensortec. Source code of 
sample applications and SensorAPI are provided with the COINES library as 
a package. The user can modify, compile and run the sample applications. 

COINES can be used to see how to use the SensorAPI in an embedded 
environment and allows convenient data logging.

Licence Terms and Conditions for the Use of Bosch Sensortec GmbH, 
Reutlingen BSECxxx Software 

Status: July 2016 

1. Scope 

1.1 The subject matter of the licence terms and conditions shall be the 
use by the person that or legal entity who’s representative has 
accepted these Terms & Conditions (subsequently “User”) of the 
Software specified in Ex-hibit 1 (subsequently “Software”), produced 
by Bosch Sensortec GmbH (subsequently “BST”) or distributed by the 
latter in its own name, including the associated program documentation. 

1.2 Unless otherwise agreed with the User in individual cases the User 
shall ex-clusively receive the Software in the executable file format 
“exe” for self-installation on his system. The User may download it 
via the BST Homepage – the online portal for the customers. 

1.3 The Software and the associated operating instructions shall be 
protected by copyright. In relation to the User all rights in respect of 
the Software shall ex-clusively belong to BST. 

2. Scope of use 

2.1 On the basis of these licence terms and conditions User shall 
receive a non-exclusive, non-transferable right of use in the software 
for developing refer-ence designs (demonstrator for testing the 
functionality of hardware and software components during the development 
phase) containing BST envi-ronmental sensor devices and to use the 
Software in combination with BST environmental sensor devices in 
products of User. 

2.2 Further on BST hereby grants to User the non-exclusive and 
non-transferable right to generate and copy compiled object code of the 
Software and to use and sell compiled object code of the Software 
worldwide in com-bination with BST environmental sensor devices in 
products of User. 

2.3 Use shall mean the loading, display, running, transmission and 
storage of the Software for purposes of its operation and the processing 
of data sets on the system of the User, on which the Software is 
installed. 

2.4 The User shall be entitled to create a back-up copy of the Software, 
which must display a copy of the original description (including the 
note on copy-right). The use of the back-up copy shall only be 
permissible if the original copy of the Software supplied by BST 
deteriorates or is destroyed. The use of the back-up copy by the User 
shall also be governed by these licence terms and conditions. In all 
other respects the User shall not be entitled to copy the Software or 
the program documentation or parts thereof outside the permitted use 
without the prior written approval of BST. 

2.5 Without the approval of BST the user shall not be entitled to 
revise, change or otherwise amend the Software, link it to other 
programs via other inter-faces than the ones provided, retranslate 
(decompile) it, remove, circumvent or change security codes or features 
used for the identification of the Soft-ware or remove from the Software 
and the program documentation details of the proprietorship, copyrights 
or other industrial property rights of BST. The provisions of §§ 69 d 
paragraph 3 and § 69 e UrhG shall not be affect-ed. 

2.6 The right of termination of the licence without notice for cause 
shall be re-served. Cause for a termination without notice by BST shall 
exist, in particu-lar, if the User culpably violates the provisions of 
section 2 of these licence terms and conditions in more than a merely 
immaterial manner. In such a case the user shall not be entitled to a 
claim for repayment of the amount paid for the provision of the Software 
and the granting of the licence. BST shall reserve the right to claim 
additional damages. 

2.7 The right of use of the User in respect of the software provided 
shall termi-nate on expiry of the licence. The User shall delete all the 
copies installed on his systems as well as copies of the Software on 
separate data media and also destroy the operating instructions 
provided. BST must be informed in writing of the complete deletion or 
destruction and conclusive proof of this must be provided if requested 
by BST. 

3. Obligations of User 

3.1 The User shall not misuse the Software or have it misused in any 
way. The User shall also not attempt to retrieve information or data 
without proper au-thorisation or to have it retrieved by unauthorised 
third parties or interfere with the software or have it interfered with. 

3.2 The User shall promptly inform BST in writing (§ 126 b BGB) of any 
defects or faults affecting the contractual services and explain the 
circumstances and the manner in which the defect or fault occurs as well 
as actively assist BST in ascertaining the cause of the malfunction by 
supplying relevant doc-umentation (hard copy, etc.) and other documents 
and data, etc. required by BST for analysing and correcting the defect 
or fault. If the examination of the User’s defect notice by BST shows 
that BST was not responsible for the defect then BST may reserve the 
right to charge the cost of the examination of the defect notice to the 
User. This provision, however, shall not apply if the User applying due 
care and diligence would not have been able to know that the malfunction 
was not within the area of responsibility of BST. 

3.3 When using the Software and the contractual services the User shall 
comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. The User shall 
not be permit-ted to use data or contents, which are illegal or infringe 
third party industrial property rights or other third party rights. 

4. Updates / Upgrades 

4.1 BST shall continue to develop the Software at its discretion and 
provide the User with minor functional improvements as well as 
corrections as they arise (Updates). The updates shall be provided to 
the User free of charge as a download or in another suitable format. BST 
shall always maintain and fur-ther develop the current version of the 
Software. This shall apply in particular to the compatibility of the 
Software with new sensor technology. The User, therefore, shall be 
obligated to always use the current version of the Software. 

4.2 BST shall reserve the right to remove certain functions – in 
particular those, which are not or hardly used – from the Software as 
well as introduce new important functions and upgrades on a chargeable 
basis. 

5. Warranty 

5.1 Technical data, specifications and performance details in public 
communica-tions, in particular in advertising media, shall not 
constitute quality descrip-tions. The functionality of the Software 
shall correspond to the description in the operating instructions and 
any additional agreements made in this re-spect. 

5.2 Claims for defects shall become statute-barred after twelve months 
unless the defect has been maliciously kept silent. 

5.3 Any enforcement of claims for defects shall require that the 
respective de-fect is reported in writing within one week of its initial 
discovery. 

5.4 BST shall not be liable in cases, in which the User has made changes 
to the Software, unless such changes did not affect the origin of the 
defect. 

5.5 User shall care for and guarantees that the Software shall neither 
be used nor combined with other software, including but not limited to 
Open Source Software, in any way that may cause viral effect (due to 
combination or use of Software together with other software the owner or 
representative of the owner can claim that for the Software license 
conditions applicable for the other software would apply as well) to the 
Software. 

5.6 User shall indemnify and hold BST harmless from and against any 
liability, claims, demands and expenses (including attorney fees) 
resulting from any actual or alleged defect or damages or injuries 
(including death) related to the Software sold or otherwise distributed 
by User or failure by User to give appropriate instructions of use or 
recall defective products containing the Software. 

6. Liability 

6.1 In all cases of contractual and non-contractual liability BST shall 
only be lia-ble subject to the following limitations: 

a) with the full amount in case of intent and also if a quality 
characteristic warranted by BST is missing; 

b) in cases of gross negligence only up to the amount of the foreseeable 
damage, which was to be prevented by the obligation violated; 

c) in all other cases: only in case of a violation of a material 
contractual obligation jeopardising the contractual purpose, but in any 
case only up to the amount of the foreseeable damage. The liability 
shall be limited to Euro 100 per claim and to a total maximum amount of 
Euro 400 in respect of this contract. 

6.2 The limitations of liability in accordance with clause 6.1 shall not 
apply to personal injury and claims based on the product liability law. 

6.3 BST shall be entitled to the defence of contributory fault or 
negligence. 

6.4 Clause 7.2 shall apply accordingly to the limitation period and the 
statutory period of limitation shall apply to claims in accordance with 
clause 1 a) and clause 2. The limitation period in accordance with 
sentence 1 shall begin at the point in time defined in § 199 paragraph 
1 BGB. It shall apply at the latest after expiry of the maximum time 
limits stated in § 199 paragraph 3 and 4 BGB. 

7. Miscellaneous 

7.1 These licence terms and conditions shall also apply to later 
versions (Up-dates) and upgrades of the Software made available by BST 
to the User, un-less agreed otherwise when such later versions or 
upgrades are provided. 

7.2 If one or more provisions of these licence terms and conditions or 
certain clauses are or become invalid or if the terms and conditions 
suffer from de-fects in law this shall not affect the remaining 
provisions. In such a case the parties shall undertake to agree a valid 
provision coming economically as close as possible to the invalid 
provision if the parties had known its invalidity or absence. 

7.3 There shall be no side agreements to these terms and conditions of 
use. Changes and amendments of these terms and conditions of use shall 
be made in writing. This requirement may only be waived in writing. 

7.4 These terms and conditions of use and any and all obligations 
arising there-from shall be subject to the law of the Federal Republic 
of Germany, how-ever, excluding the Convention on International Sale of 
Goods (CISG). 

7.5 The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all legal disputes arising 
from or in connection with this contract shall be the place of the 
registered office of BST. BST, however, shall also be entitled to bring 
legal proceedings at the general place of jurisdiction of the User.
